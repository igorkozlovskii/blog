    "section": "1. Setup: VirtualGL on server and client",
    "text": "1. Setup: VirtualGL on server and client\nAssumptions:\n\nServer: Ubuntu 22.04, NVIDIA GPU, proprietary driver installed.\nClient: Linux desktop (Xorg or Wayland).\nYou can SSH into the server.\n\nYou need VirtualGL on both the server and your local machine.\n\nIf you don’t have sudo on the server, you need an admin to do this section once (install VirtualGL, run vglserver_config, add you to vglusers). After that, everything below works unprivileged.\n\n\n1.1. Install VirtualGL on the server\nDownload and install the .deb (example URL, adjust version if needed):\n# on the server\ncurl -L -o /tmp/virtualgl.deb \\\n  https://packagecloud.io/dcommander/virtualgl/packages/any/any/virtualgl_3.1.1-20240228_amd64.deb/download\n\nsudo dpkg -i /tmp/virtualgl.deb\nThen run the configuration script:\nsudo /opt/VirtualGL/bin/vglserver_config\nIn the interactive dialog I typically choose:\n\n1) GLX + EGL if I don’t care about local Wayland logins on that machine (most compatible, but may force local users to X11), or\n3) EGL only if the machine is basically a headless GPU box and I don’t want to mess with GLX.\n\nOther important prompts:\n\nRestrict 3D access to group vglusers? → Y\nAdd your user to vglusers? → Y\n\nAfter that:\n\nLog out and log back in so the new group membership is active, or\nrun newgrp vglusers once in an existing shell as a quick workaround.\n\nYou do not need to run newgrp vglusers on every login; it’s a one-time thing after being added to the group.\n\n\n1.2. Install VirtualGL on your local machine\nSame idea on the client:\n# on your local machine\ncurl -L -o /tmp/virtualgl.deb \\\n  https://packagecloud.io/dcommander/virtualgl/packages/any/any/virtualgl_3.1.1-20240228_amd64.deb/download\n\nsudo dpkg -i /tmp/virtualgl.deb\nThat’s usually it. No additional configuration needed on the client side.\n\n\n1.3. Make the VirtualGL environment automatic (recommended)\nOn the server, once your account is in vglusers and you’ve re-logged, add this to ~/.bashrc (or ~/.zshrc):\n# VirtualGL defaults for this server\nexport VGL_DISPLAY=egl\nexport VGL_IMAGEQUAL=95\nexport VGL_NPROCS=4\nIf you only want this for interactive shells, you can wrap it:\nif [ -n \"$PS1\" ]; then\n    export VGL_DISPLAY=egl\n    export VGL_IMAGEQUAL=95\n    export VGL_NPROCS=4\nfi\nNow, every time you SSH in (including via vglconnect), these variables are already set and you don’t have to think about them.\nAlternative patterns if you don’t want permanent exports:\n\nDefine a helper function in ~/.bashrc:\nvglenv() {\n    export VGL_DISPLAY=egl\n    export VGL_IMAGEQUAL=95\n    export VGL_NPROCS=4\n}\nThen per session:\nvglconnect -s user@server\nvglenv\nvglrun pymol protein.pdb\nOr keep your dotfiles clean and just use an env prefix:\nVGL_DISPLAY=egl VGL_IMAGEQUAL=95 VGL_NPROCS=4 vglrun pymol protein.pdb\n\nI personally prefer the “put it in ~/.bashrc and forget about it” approach."

    "text": "2. Option A — PyMOL over SSH with vglconnect (my default)\nThis is what I use most of the time: you open a single SSH session that is “VirtualGL-aware” and then start PyMOL with GPU acceleration.\nNo desktop, no VNC, just a PyMOL window that appears locally.\n\n2.1. Open a VirtualGL SSH session\nOn your local machine:\n/opt/VirtualGL/bin/vglconnect -s user@SERVER_IP_OR_NAME\nThis runs ssh under the hood, but also sets up the env so that vglrun will work out of the box.\nYou’ll now be in a shell on the server.\n\nYou could also do a regular ssh and then call /opt/VirtualGL/bin/vglrun explicitly; I just find vglconnect convenient.\n\n\n\n2.2. (Optional) Set VirtualGL env for this session\nIf you followed §1.3 and added the exports to ~/.bashrc, you can skip this – the variables are already set.\nIf not, you can either call your helper:\nvglenv\nor do the exports manually:\nexport VGL_DISPLAY=egl\nexport VGL_IMAGEQUAL=95\nexport VGL_NPROCS=4\nor use the one-liner prefix later:\nVGL_DISPLAY=egl VGL_IMAGEQUAL=95 VGL_NPROCS=4 vglrun pymol protein.pdb\nYou do not normally need newgrp vglusers here; that was only required once right after being added to the group (or you just log out/in instead).\nBefore running PyMOL for the first time on a machine, it’s worth checking that VirtualGL sees the NVIDIA GPU:\nvglrun glxinfo -B | egrep 'OpenGL vendor|OpenGL renderer'\nYou want to see something like:\n\nOpenGL vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation\nOpenGL renderer string: NVIDIA GeForce ...\n\nIf you see llvmpipe or Mesa, you’re not using the GPU.\n\n\n2.3. Run PyMOL via VirtualGL\nNow just:\nvglrun pymol /path/to/your_structure.pdb\nA PyMOL window should pop up on your local desktop.\nFrom PyMOL’s point of view it’s running on the server, with access to server-side file paths and GPUs. From your point of view it behaves like a local app, but:\n\nless lag than X forwarding,\nproper OpenGL on the remote GPU,\nworks even when RDP/AnyDesk/etc. are blocked.\n\nInside PyMOL I also enable this setting for correct visualization of surface with transparency:\nset transparency_mode, 2"

Option B — TurboVNC + VirtualGL (full remote desktop)\nSometimes you want more than just PyMOL:\n\nmultiple terminals,\na web browser,\nperhaps another molecular viewer (Chimera(X), VMD, Coot, etc.),\nall running in a persistent remote session you can reconnect to.\n\nFor that, I use TurboVNC + VirtualGL:\n\nTurboVNC provides the remote desktop.\nVirtualGL provides GPU-accelerated 3D rendering inside that desktop.\n\n\n3.1. Install TurboVNC and a lightweight desktop\nOn the server (again, admin once; if you don’t have sudo, they do this step):\n# TurboVNC server\ncurl -L -o /tmp/turbovnc.deb \\\n  https://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc/files/3.1/turbovnc_3.1_amd64.deb/download\n\nsudo dpkg -i /tmp/turbovnc.deb\n\n# lightweight desktop environment\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install -y xfce4 xfce4-terminal dbus-x11\nYou only need one DE; I use Xfce because it’s small and works well over VNC.\n\n\n3.2. Create a VNC startup script\nCreate ~/.vnc/xstartup.turbovnc on the server:\ncat &gt; ~/.vnc/xstartup.turbovnc &lt;&lt;'SH'\n#!/bin/sh\nunset SESSION_MANAGER\nunset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\n\nexport XDG_SESSION_TYPE=x11\nexport XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/xdg-$USER\nmkdir -p \"$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR\"\nchmod 700 \"$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR\"\n\nexec dbus-launch --exit-with-session startxfce4\nSH\n\nchmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup.turbovnc\nThis script will be used to start the Xfce desktop when the VNC server launches.\n\n\n3.3. Start a VNC desktop on the server\nOn the server:\n/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver :1 \\\n  -localhost \\\n  -geometry 1920x1080 \\\n  -depth 24 \\\n  -xstartup \"$HOME/.vnc/xstartup.turbovnc\"\nNotes:\n\n:1 → display number; this corresponds to TCP port 5901.\n-localhost → ensures that only local connections (i.e. via SSH tunnel) can reach it.\n\nYou can check active sessions:\n/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver -list\n\n\n3.4. Connect from your local machine (SSH tunnel + viewer)\nOn your local machine:\n# Terminal 1: SSH tunnel (keep this open)\nssh -NT -L 5901:localhost:5901 user@SERVER_IP_OR_NAME\nThen, in another terminal or via your GUI:\n# connect with a VNC viewer\nvncviewer localhost:1\n# or:\n# /opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncviewer localhost:1\nYou should now see an Xfce desktop running from the server.\n\n\n3.5. Run PyMOL with VirtualGL inside the VNC desktop\nInside that desktop, open a terminal.\nIf you’ve put the VirtualGL exports in ~/.bashrc, they should already be active in that terminal, so you can go straight to:\nvglrun glxinfo -B | egrep 'OpenGL vendor|OpenGL renderer'\nvglrun pymol /path/to/your_structure.pdb\nIf not, you can either call vglenv (if you defined it) or export manually:\nexport VGL_DISPLAY=egl\nexport VGL_IMAGEQUAL=95\nexport VGL_NPROCS=4\nvglrun pymol /path/to/your_structure.pdb\nAgain, you normally don’t need newgrp vglusers here as long as your group membership is already active (you re-logged after being added).\nWhen you’re done:\n/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver -kill :1"
