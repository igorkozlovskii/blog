# Hi, I'm Igor

I work at the intersection of **structural bioinformatics**, **deep learning**, and **molecule generation for drug design**. I like building models and tools that are actually usable for large-scale virtual screening.

## Currently

- PhD student in computer science at Constructor University (Bremen).
- Researcher at a startup working on computational methods for drug discovery.
- Working on binding-site prediction and generative models for small molecules / ligands.

## Research interests

- Deep learning on 3D molecular data (grids, point clouds, graphs).
- Binding site identification and ion/ligand specificity.
- Generative models for molecule design (VAEs, diffusion, hierarchical models).
- Practical pipelines: from PDB datasets to screening-ready models.

## Selected work

- **Spatiotemporal identification of druggable binding sites** – deep-learning
  framework to detect transient pockets from MD simulations  
  (*Communications Biology*, 2020, [10.1038/s42003-020-01350-0](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-020-01350-0)).
- **Protein–peptide binding site detection** – 3D CNN models for protein–peptide
  interfaces  
  (*JCIM*, 2021, [10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00475](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00475)).
- **Binding site detection in nucleic acid macromolecules** – extension of
  structure-based deep learning to RNA/DNA binding sites  
  (*NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics*, 2021, [10.1093/nargab/lqab111](https://doi.org/10.1093/nargab/lqab111)).
- **Review: computational methods for binding site prediction on macromolecules** –
  overview of current approaches and open challenges  
  (*Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics*, 2025, [10.1017/S003358352500006X](https://doi.org/10.1017/S003358352500006X)).

In the meantime, you can see some of the technical background in my [Research Blog](blog.qmd).

## About this site

This website has two main parts:

- **Research Blog** - technical posts about structural bioinformatics, deep learning, datasets, and tooling.
- **Notes** - more informal things: music, books, generative art, and various experiments.

The goal is to document things I find interesting or useful enough to write down.
